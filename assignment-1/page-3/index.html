    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        Today, language technology and the linguistic sciences are confronted with a vast array of language resources,
        richly structured, large and diverse. Texts, recordings, dictionaries, annotations, software, protocols, data
        models, file formats, newsgroups and web indexes are just some of these resources. The resources are growing in
        size, in number, in diversity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, multiple communities depend on language resources, including linguists, engineers, teachers and actual
        speakers. Many individuals and institutions provide key pieces of the infrastructure, including archivists,
        software
        developers, and publishers. The sponsors and promoters of language technology and the linguistic sciences --
        professional associations, government funding agencies, and non-governmental organizations - also need to access
        and
        deploy language resources. These communities are large. For example, the LinguistList network counts over 13,000
        members. The Linguistic Data Consortium produces linguistic databases for some 1,000 organizations. The number
        of
        individuals having an immediate interest in language resources numbers in the tens of thousands. These
        communities
        are growing in size, in number, in diversity.
    </p>
    <p>
        And today, we have unprecedented opportunities to connect these communities to the language resources they need.
        First, inexpensive mass storage technology permits large resources to be stored in digital form, while the
        Extensible Markup Language (<abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>) and Unicode provide flexible
        ways to represent structured data
        and
        ensure its long-term survival. Second, digital publication - both on and off the world wide web - is the most
        practical and efficient means of sharing language resources. Finally, a standard resource classification model,
        the
        Dublin Core Metadata Set, together with an interchange method provided by the Open Archives Initiative, make it
        possible to construct a union catalog over multiple repositories and archives. This infrastructure is a new
        invention; it has the bottom-up, distributed character of the web, while simultaneously having the efficient,
        structured nature of a centralized database. This combination is well-suited to the language resource community,
        where the available data is growing rapidly and where a large user-base is consistent in how it describes its
        resource needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In December 2000, an NSF-sponsored workshop on Web-Based Language Documentation and Description brought together
        a a
        group of nearly 100 language software developers, linguists, and archivists who are responsible for creating
        language resources in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. Over
        four
        days of presentations, panel sessions, and working groups, the participants explored the opportunities listed
        above.
        The outcome of the workshop was the founding of the Open Language Archives Community (<abbr
            title="Open Language Archives Community">OLAC</abbr>),
        an
        application of the Open Archives Initiative to digital archives of language resources. An advisory board was
        established and alpha-testers identified. This project will provide technical infrastructure for the Open
        Language
        Archives Community.
    </p>

    <h2>2. The Vision for an Open Language Archives Community</h2>

    <p>Before presenting the technical background to the project, it would be instructive to give a hypothetical example
        to
        illustrate what the Open Language Archives Community will be like. Suppose that a user goes to an OLAC ``service
        provider'' website, which presents a form that permits focused searching on OLAC metadata fields.</p>

    <p>
        In this imaginary interaction, a user is searching for data from a Quechua language. The system discovers that
        ``Quechua'' actually denotes 59 different languages, and the user is taken to a controlled vocabulary server
        which
        permits the identifier for the language or interest, in this case Hu치nuco Quechua, to be entered. Search
        continues
        and the resulting display - which looks like the summary of hits produced by a web search engine - lists field
        notes, a dictionary and a grammar. From this page, the user navigates to the full metadata record for the
        dictionary, shown in Figure 1.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
        The record consists of a list of optional, repeatable metadata elements. Some elements can only take a
        restricted
        range
        of values, so called <i>controlled vocabularies</i>. For example, <b>Subject.language</b> has values defined by
        RFC
        1766.
        <b>Format.markup</b> will have values defined by OLAC, consisting of a namespace and a name.

    </p>
    <p>
        The imaginary user continues the exploration, now wanting to find out if there are any tools which understand
        the
        format
        sil-sf. The query is launched by clicking on the TOOLS hyperlink for the Format.markup field. The result is a
        summary
        listing of tools, including Shoebox, HyperLex, EUDICO and CLAN, which are archived in four different
        repositories.
        The
        user pulls up the full metadata record for Shoebox, and sees a display much like the one above, but including
        <b>Rights.openness</b> for the level of availability of the software, Relation.requires for the documentation,
        and
        Identifier
        for the external URL to the software. Some additional fields specifically for software are <b>Type.os</b> for
        the
        supported
        operating systems and <b>Type.functionality</b> for the functions this software can perform.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the user seeks advice on the appropriateness of this software for the task at hand, and clicks on an
        ADVICE
        hyperlink. Some 150 hits are displayed, with such titles as: ``Analyzing data with Shoebox,'' ``Identifying the
        primary
        audience dictionary,'' ``Data-entry templates in Shoebox,'' ``Organizing a dictionary by roots vs lexemes.'' As
        before,
        the user navigates to a full metadata record for a particular choice, and this provides the entry point to the
        resource.
    </p>
    <p>
        Standing back from this particular interaction, we can observe that the individuals who use and create language
        resources are looking for three things: data, tools, and advice. Figure 2 diagrams this situation.
    </p>
    <figure class="border">
        <img src="./src/images/figure2.gif" alt="Figure 2: Ideally the user has access as needed" />
        <figcaption>Figure 2: Ideally the user has access as needed</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        By <b>DATA</b> we mean any information that documents or describes a language, such as a published monograph, a
        computer data
        file, or even a shoebox full of hand-written index cards. The information could range in content from unanalyzed
        sound
        recordings to fully transcribed and annotated texts to a complete descriptive grammar. By <b>TOOLS</b> we mean
        computational
        resources that facilitate creating, viewing, querying, or otherwise using language data. Tools include not just
        software
        programs, but also the digital resources that the programs depend on, such as fonts, stylesheets, and document
        type
        definitions. By <b>ADVICE</b> we mean any information about what data sources are reliable, what tools are
        appropriate in a
        given situation, what practices to follow when creating new data, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, today's user does not have ready access to the data, tools, and advice that are needed. Figure 3
        offers a
        diagrammatic view of the reality. Some archives (e.g. Archive 1) do have a site on the Internet which the user
        is
        able
        to find, so the resources of that archive are accessible. Other archives (e.g. Archive 2) are on the Internet,
        so
        the
        user could access them in theory, but the user has no idea they exist so they are not accessible in practice.
        Still
        other archives (e.g. Archive 3) are not even on the Internet. And there are potentially hundreds of archives
        (e.g.
        Archive n) that the user needs to know about. Tools and advice are out there as well, but are at many different
        sites.
    </p>
    <figure class="border">
        <img src="./src/images/figure3.gif" alt="Figure 3: In reality the user can't always get there from here" />
        <figcaption>Figure 3: In reality the user can't always get there from here</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        There are many other problems inherent in the current situation. For instance, the user may not be able to find
        all
        the
        existing data about the language of interest because different sites have called it by different names. The user
        may
        not
        be able to use an accessible data file for lack of being able to match it with the right tools. The user may
        locate
        advice that seems relevant but have no basis for judging its merits.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to bridge the gap, the individuals who use and create language documentation and description need a
        community
        that provides four things: a gateway, metadata, reviews, and standards:

    <ul>
        <li><b>GATEWAY</b>: A single portal through which users can access all available data, tools, and advice,
            regardless
            of its physical location.</li>
        <li><b>METADATA</b>: Uniform descriptions of all available data, tools, and advice, including a link to the full
            item or instructions on how to access it.</li>
        <li><b>REVIEWS</b>: Peer evaluations of available data, tools, and advice.</li>
        <li><b>STANDARDS</b>: Processes and protocols underlying all of the above, such as the metadata schema, and the
            harvesting protocol.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Figure 4 gives a diagram showing the ``Seven Pillars of Open Language Archiving'' and how they relate. In a
        graphical
        form it summarizes how a community would function to bridge the gap between the individual user and all the
        data,
        tools,
        and advice that are out there on the Internet. Note that STANDARDS here concern the computational infrastructure
        of
        the
        community. Particular formats for linguistic content (such as the TEI), would be considered tools with
        associated
        advice, and fall outside of the scope of the standards we are talking about here.

    <h2>3. Background of the Open Language Archives Community</h2>
    <h3>3.1. Language Resources</h3>

    <p><b>DATA</b>. As explained in section 2, DATA refers to any information that documents or describes a language,
        such as a
        published monograph, a computer data file, or even a shoebox full of hand-written index cards. The information
        could
        range in content from unanalyzed sound recordings to fully transcribed and annotated texts to a complete
        descriptive
        grammar. Although much language data is never published, it is often archived so that future scholars can access
        the
        work. Unfortunately, there is no international register of language archives, and no way to discover what most
        archives
        hold except by visiting them in person.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recently, in an attempt to document these language archives, Bird, Simons and Liberman conducted a survey. The
        survey
        and preliminary results are available online [<a
            href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/exploration/survey/">http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/exploration/survey/</a>], as
        are prose
        descriptions
        of each archive [<a
            href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/exploration/archives.html">http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/exploration/archives.html</a>].
        Most of the surveyed archives have a partial
        digital catalog, and about 25% have a complete digital catalog. A couple of them use MARC or TEI. We also found
        that
        a
        wide variety of catalog fields are used (or proposed) by these archives, and that no two archives use the same
        set
        of
        fields. The following list contains fields used by at least one of the archives. It gives a glimpse of the kinds
        of
        materials which are held, and also illustrates the need for consistency.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>title of the resource, transliterated title</li>
        <li>catalog number (local, ISBN, ...)</li>
        <li>date, location (e.g. of creation, encoding, publication)</li>
        <li>language id (for the resource and for its subject, alternative language names, language group)</li>

        <li>transcription type (e.g. phonetic, orthographic, gesture, musical, ...)</li>
        <li>translation type (e.g. morpheme-level, word-level, sentence-level, ...)</li>
        <li>access rights, use restrictions, copyrights, licenses, price</li>
        <li>URL for an online version of the resource, or for documentation</li>
        <li>provenance of the resource (e.g. geographical origin); historical period covered by the resource</li>
        <li>contact person/institution, address</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <b>TOOLS</b>. By TOOLS we mean computational resources that facilitate creating, viewing, querying, or otherwise
        using
        language
        data. Tools include not just software programs, but also the digital resources that the programs depend on, such
        as
        fonts, stylesheets, and document type definitions. Over the past decade, researchers in human language
        technology
        have
        created a vast array of tools, many of which are made openly available. The Association for Computational
        Linguistics
        together with the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence has created the ``Natural Language Software
        Registry'' [<a href="http://registry.dfki.de/">http://registry.dfki.de/</a>]. This is a database that describes
        130 language software tools. Its metadata
        includes license type, functionality, operating system, and the language(s) the tool works with. Interest in
        this
        repository has been stimulated recently by a workshop at last year's meeting of the ACL
        [<a href="http://elsnet.let.uu.nl/acl2000workshop.html">http://elsnet.let.uu.nl/acl2000workshop.html</a>]. A
        follow-up workshop will be held at the 2001 meeting.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>ADVICE</b>. Many internet mailing lists are concerned with language resources. Chief among them is the
        Corpora mailing
        list
        [<a href="http://www.hit.uib.no/corpora/">http://www.hit.uib.no/corpora/</a>]. Apart from conference and job
        announcements, the majority of postings on this
        mailing
        list are queries about the existence of a certain kind of resource, requests for advice about the suitability of
        resources for particular tasks, and summaries of the pointers and suggestions that were communicated directly to
        the
        person who posted the original request. A centralized version of the same process is exemplified by the LTG
        Helpdesk
        [<a href="http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/helpdesk/">http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/helpdesk/</a>]. Links pages which contain
        commentary about the resources they reference also
        constitute a kind of advice. For example, the Linguistic Exploration Page [<a
            href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/exploration/">http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/exploration/</a>]
        surveys and classifies some 60 resources available on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
        People needing advice typically resort to posting a query on one or more lists, sorting through the responses,
        and
        possibly posting a summary of responses back to the lists. However, it is often difficult to decide a good
        course of
        action, when the primary information is an uncoordinated set of suggestions originating from strangers on a
        mailing
        list. In a period of rapidly evolving technology, a wrong choice can wind up in a dead end, and painstakingly
        collected
        data ends up being unusable. Numerous experiences of this community attest to this reality.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>The size and complexity of language resources, of data, tools, and advice, is growing rapidly, and yet the
            way we
            locate
            these resources is completely haphazard. While the World-Wide Web holds the promise of unprecedented access
            to
            language
            resources, we also see the specter of frustration and chaos on an unprecedented scale. Coordination is
            urgently
            needed,
            before individual projects develop more needlessly incompatible standards, protocols, interfaces and
            methods.
        </i>
    </p>
    <h3>3.2. The Language Resources Community</h3>

    <p>
        The community appears to be arranged into three main groups. The first group is engaged in the core activity of

        activity,
        while the third group constitutes the administrative umbrella. For full details, see Figure 5.

        <i>The community is diverse, but is united by its common interest in creating, accessing and/or deploying
            language
            resources. However, when it comes to finding relevant resources, people are regularly reduced to sifting
            through the
            results returned by web search engines, then further sifting through free-form prose descriptions of
            holdings. Only
            by
            using agreed metadata can these communities be connected with the resources they need.</i>

    <h3>3.3. Bridging the Gap</h3>
    <h4>Why improved web-indexing is not enough</h4>

    <p>As the internet grows and web-indexing technologies improve one might hope that a general-purpose search engine
        should
        be sufficient to bridge the gap between people and the resources they need, but this is a vain hope. The first
        reason is
        that many language resources, such as audio files and software, are not text-based. The second reason concerns
        language
        identification, the single most important classification for language resources. If a language has a canonical
        name
        which is distinctive as a character string, then the user has a chance of finding any online resources with a
        search
        engine. However, the language may have multiple names, possibly due to the vagaries of Romanization, such as a
        language
        known variously as Fadicca, Fadicha, Fedija, Fadija, Fiadidja, Fiyadikkya, and Fedicca. The language name may
        collide
        with a word which has other interpretations that are vastly more frequent, e.g. the language names Mango and
        Santa
        Cruz.</p>

    <p>The third reason why general-purpose search engines are inadequate is the simple fact that much of the material
        is
        not,
        and will not, be documented in free prose on the web. The cataloging work will be done either systematically or
        not
        at
        all. Of course, one can always export a back-end database as HTML and let the search engines index the
        materials.
        Indeed, encouraging people to document resources and make them accessible to search engines is part of our
        vision.
        However, despite the power of web search engines, there remain many instances where people still prefer to use
        more
        formal databases to house their data.</p>

    <p>This last point bears further consideration. The challenge is to build a system for ``bringing like things
        together
        and
        differentiating among them'' [Svenonius00]. There are two dominant storage and indexing paradigms, one
        exemplified
        by
        traditional databases and one exemplified by the web. In the case of language resources, the metadata is
        coherent
        enough
        to be stored in a formal database, but sufficiently distributed and dynamic that it is impractical to maintain
        it
        centrally. Language resources occupy the middle ground between the two paradigms, neither of which will serve
        adequately. A new framework is required that permits the best of both worlds, namely bottom-up, distributed
        initiatives,
        along with consistent, centralized finding aids. The Dublin Core and the Open Archives Initiative provide the
        framework
        we need.
    </p>

    <h4>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</h4>

    <p>
        The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative began in 1995 to develop conventions for resource discovery on the web
        [<a href="http://purl.org/DC/">http://purl.org/DC/</a>]. The Dublin Core metadata elements represent a broad,
        interdisciplinary consensus about the
        core
        set of elements that are likely to be widely useful to support resource discovery. The Dublin Core consists of
        15
        metadata elements, where each element is optional and repeatable: <b>Title, Creator, Subject, Description,
            Publisher,
            Contributor, Date, Type, Format, Identifier, Source, Language, Relation, Coverage, Rights</b>. This metadata
        set can be
        used
        to describe resources that exist in digital or traditional formats.</p>

    <p>
        In ``Dublin Core Qualifiers'' two kinds of qualifications are allowed: encoding schemes and refinements
        [<a
            href="http://purl.org/dc/documents/rec/dcmes-qualifiers-20000711.htm">http://purl.org/dc/documents/rec/dcmes-qualifiers-20000711.htm</a>].
        An encoding scheme specifies a particular
        controlled
        vocabulary or notation for expressing the value of an element. The encoding scheme serves to aid a client system
        in
        interpreting the exact meaning of the element content. A refinement makes the meaning of the element more
        specific.
        For
        example, a <b>Subject</b> element can be given a language refinement to restrict its interpretation to concern
        the
        ``subject
        language'' of the resource. A <b>Language</b> element can be encoded using the conventions of RFC 1766 to
        unambiguously
        identify the language is written (or spoken).
    </p>

    <h4>The Open Archives Initiative</h4>

    <p>
        The Open Archives initiative (<abbr title="Open Archives initiative">OAI</abbr>) was launched in October 1999 to
        provide a common framework across electronic
        preprint
        archives [<a href="http://www.openarchives.org">http://www.openarchives.org</a>], and it has since been
        broadened to
        include digital repositories of scholarly
        materials regardless of their type.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the OAI infrastructure, each participating archive implements a repository, a network accessible server
        offering
        public access to archive holdings. The primary object in an OAI-conformant repository is called an item, having
        a
        unique
        identifier and being associated with one or more metadata records. Each metadata record describes an archive
        holding,
        which is any kind of primary resource such as a document, data, software, a recording, a physical artifact, a
        digital
        surrogate, and so forth. Each metadata record will usually contain a reference to an entry point for the
        holding,
        such
        as a URL or a physical location, as shown in Figure 6.
    </p>

    <figure class="border">
        <img src="./src/images/figure6.gif" alt="Figure 6: The Relationship Between an OAI Repository and an Archive" />
        <figcaption>Figure 6: The Relationship Between an OAI Repository and an Archive</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        To implement the OAI infrastructure, a participating archive must comply with two standards: the OAI shared
        metadata
        set
        (Dublin Core), which facilitates interoperability across all communities participating in the OAI, and the OAI
        metadata
        harvesting protocol, which allows software services to query a repository using HTTP requests.
    </p>
    <p>
        OAI archives are called ``data providers,'' though they are strictly just metadata providers. Typically, data
        providers
        will also have a submission procedure, together with a long-term storage system, and a mechanism permitting
        users to
        obtain materials from the archive. An OAI ``service provider'' is a third party that provides end-user services
        (such as
        search functions over union catalogs) based on metadata harvested from one or more OAI data providers. Figure 7
        illustrates a single service provider accessing three data providers. End-users only interact with service
        providers.

    <h3>3.4. Applying the OAI to Language Resources</h3>

    <p>
        The OAI infrastructure is a new invention; it has the bottom-up, distributed character of the web, while
        simultaneously
        having the efficient, structured nature of a centralized database. This combination is well-suited to the
        language
        resource community, where the available data is growing rapidly and where a large user-base is fairly consistent
        in
        how
        it describes its resource needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In December 2000, an NSF-sponsored workshop on Web-Based Language Documentation and Description brought together
        a
        group
        of some 100 linguists, archivists, software developers, publishers and funding agencies, who are responsible for
        creating language resources in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and
        Australia.
        The
        outcome of the workshop was the founding of the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC), which extends the Open
        Archives
        Initiative to archives of language resources. An advisory board was established and alpha-testers identified.
        This
        section reports on the workshop and its primary outcome.
    </p>

    <h4>The Philadelphia Workshop</h4>

    <p>
        In December 2000, the University of Pennsylvania hosted a four-day workshop involving language resource experts
        from
        all
        over the world, organized by Steven Bird and Gary Simons [<a
            href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/exploration/expl2000/">http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/exploration/expl2000/</a>].
        The
        goal
        of
        the workshop was as follows:

    <blockquote>
        This workshop will lay the foundation of an open, web-based infrastructure for collecting, storing and
        disseminating
        the
        primary materials which document and describe human languages, including wordlists, lexicons, annotated signals,
        interlinear texts, paradigms, field notes, and linguistic descriptions, as well as the metadata which indexes
        and
        classifies these materials. The infrastructure will support the modeling, creation, archiving and access of
        these
        materials, using centralized repositories of metadata, data, best practice guidelines, and open software tools.
    </blockquote>

    Albert Bickford (SIL), described the shared concerns which united the extremely diverse group of participants as
    follows:

    <ol>
        <li>a primary concern for descriptive (as distinguished from theoretical) linguistics;</li>
        <li>a desire to make language materials available, to communities of speakers and the general public as well as
            scholars;</li>
        <li>an interest in taking advantage of the internet, which provides a means of publishing such materials that
            bypasses
            the
            limitations of traditional publication (since the costs are so much lower, and thus appropriate for
            materials
            that
            have
            smaller audiences);
        </li>
        <li>awareness that many materials may be less than fully-polished yet still valuable to some people and worth
            archiving;
        </li>
        <li>a sense of frustration with the currently confused state of the art in data formats, especially fonts and
            character
            encoding, and the lack of good information about how best to archive and publish on the web;</li>
        <li>awareness of the large amount of data that is in data formats which will be obsolete in a few years (and
            thus a
            willingness to accept data in whatever form it is in, while also seeing a need for software to help convert
            data to
            newer formats);</li> and
        <li>a strong suspicion toward and distrust of rigid requirements, yet a willingness to adopt standards
            voluntarily
            when
            their usefulness has been demonstrated.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        The workshop itself consisted of about 40 presentations, 3 panel sessions, and several working group sessions
        (all
        materials, including the program, papers, presentation materials and biographical information about the
        participants
        are
        available online from the above URL). The presentations covered various aspects of the OLAC model, the Open
        Archives
        Initiative, metadata for describing language resources, the concerns of various stake-holders, descriptions of
        projects
        and demonstrations of systems. The starting point for working group sessions was a requirements document, a
        comprehensive and compact statement of the needs that unite the various communities.
    </p>
    <h4>The Open Language Archives Community</h4>

    <p>The primary outcome of the workshop was the founding of the Open Language Archives Community, and with it the
        identification of an advisory board, alpha testers and member archives. Details of these groups are available
        from
        the
        OLAC Gateway [<a href="http://www.language-archives.org">http://www.language-archives.org</a>].</p>

    <p>Recall that the OAI Community is defined by the archives which comply with the OAI Metadata Harvesting Protocol
        and
        that
        register with the OAI. Any compliant repository can register as an Open Archive, and the metadata provided by an
        Open
        Archive is open to the public. Now, OAI data providers may support metadata standards in addition to the Dublin
        Core.
        Thus, a specialist community can define a metadata format which is specific to its domain. Service providers,
        data
        participants agreed unanimously that the OAI provides a significant piece of the infrastructure
        needed
        for
        the language
        providers and users that employ this specialized metadata format constitute an OAI \emph{subcommunit}. The
        worksho
        resources community.</p>

    <p>
        In the same way that OLAC represents a specialized subcommunity with respect to the entire Open Archives
        community,
        there are specialized subcommunities within the scope of OLAC. For instance, the ISLE Meta Data Initiative is
        developing
        archived language resources that of this kind, such a metadata scheme would give much richer
        description.
        This
        a detailed metadata scheme for corpora of recorded speech events and their associated descriptions \cite{IMDI0}.
        Fo
        specialized subcommunity can implement its own service provider that offers focused searching based on its own
        rich
        metadata set.

        The LDC Prototype. The Linguistic Data Consortium has harvested the catalogs of three language resource archives
        (LDC,
        ELRA, DFKI) and created a demonstration prototype, available online. A search for `language=Bulgarian' returns
        records
        from all three archives, as shown in Figure 8.
